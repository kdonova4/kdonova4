# üëã Hey there, I'm Kevin Donovan

I'm a full stack developer with a focus on **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **React**, and **SQL**. I recently completed an intensive Software Engineering training program through HTD Talent and earned my **B.S. in Computer Science** from UNC Charlotte.

During my time at HTD Talent, I gained hands-on experience building full-stack applications using Java, SQL, and React. I worked on real-world projects in a collaborative team setting, followed agile practices, participated in regular code reviews, and applied clean code principles to produce maintainable, testable software.
